InvokeFiglet.png:
    In this screenshot, the figlet function is invoked. This function comes from the OpenFaaS store and creates ASCII banners from a text input. 
    The function is first deployed and then inspected. Finally, the function is passed a string argument and invoked.

journalctl_faasd.png:
    This command gets the content of the systemd (system and service manager) journal. In this particular instance, the faasd log is queried with only the 40 most recent lines displayed.

OpenFaaS_Gateway.png:
    This screenshot shows the OpenFaaS gateway UI that displays the currently deployed functions. Each of the function tabs will open a page specific to the function
    and give the status along with other statistics of the function.

invoke_slackrequest_slackinteractive.png:
    This screenshots shows the invocation of the slack-request and slack-interactive functions. These functions were each invoked twice, using both the curl method and the faas-cli method.
