5)  To pass different arguments to the functions you could either change the value in the [-d "some_value"] curl option or you
    can change the value in the [echo "some_value"] echo command that is piped with the faas-cli invoke command. 

6)  One way to change the slack-interactive function would be to string compare the "req" parameter of the handle method.
    If the "req" is equal to some string or url, then the function could output a different data then it normally does.
    TODO: test this on the slack-interactive function
